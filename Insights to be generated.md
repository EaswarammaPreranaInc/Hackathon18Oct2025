BI / Analytics question bank (use as hackathon tasks)

I split these into core (easy), intermediate, and stretch (harder) so teams can pick difficulty.

Core (easy / required baseline — 2 to 3 of these)

Total revenue & orders over time — compute daily/weekly/monthly revenue, number of orders, average order value (AOV). (Time series + simple visualization)

Top 10 products by revenue — list product_id, product_name, total revenue, units sold.

Top cities by revenue — which cities contribute the most to revenue and orders?

Intermediate

Revenue by category & month — show a month × category pivot (heatmap) and identify seasonality.

Payment method analysis — which payment methods have the highest refund rates and average order value?

Customer cohort analysis (retention) — cohort by signup month: % retained and % repeat purchasers over 3, 6, 12 months.

Repeat customer contribution — % of revenue from repeat buyers vs new buyers.

Stretch / Advanced

RFM segmentation — compute Recency, Frequency, Monetary and segment customers into buckets, then profile top segments.

Delivery performance analysis — average shipping time (shipped -> delivered) by carrier and city; identify carriers with highest late deliveries & return rates.

Product cannibalization / cross-sell — find top 5 product pairs often bought together (market-basket analysis / co-occurrence).

Anomaly detection — detect days with unusually high refund or return rates (e.g., > 3 sigma from moving avg).

LTV (6-month) prediction baseline — compute historical 6-month LTV per cohort (can be descriptive, not ML).
